Shipwright Tests
----------------

## Running the Tests

The tests are written using Behave Framework, written in Python, thus you will need the common Python tooling to run it locally.

Given you have Python installed, start and activate a VirtualEnv for the project with:

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

And then you can run `behave` directly:


```bash
behave --verbose
```
